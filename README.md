===================

For Johns Hopkins MOOC

This repo is part of coursework for a Coursera online course in Data Science.  The course is the initial course of a Coursera Specialization in Data Science consisting of a number of courses.  While I have not decided to engage the full Specialization, what I learn from this course will have a bearing on that decision.

The idea of gaining some knowledge of Data is intriguging, the major question is "Can I learn enough to make a difference in my skills?"
